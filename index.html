        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I've been working as a software developer for around 4 years now and it has been just that work.</p>
        <p>
            I'm trying to find the joy and fun in programming again by taking control of my career and move in a direction
            I want to go which is front end development. I have a wide range of experience, but never got the oppourtunity to
            start at the start, so I'm flying through the "Complete Web Development Bootcamp" series on udemy and building that
            foundation and cemeting previous learnings
